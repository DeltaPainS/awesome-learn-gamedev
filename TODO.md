# TODO

 - Find some Production resources!!!!

 - For longevity, extract all video links from each youtube playlist to a separate markdown file and link them beneath the playlist, just in case a playlist gets lost.
    - A tutorial on how to extract a youtube playlist: [https://dtomoffcpa.medium.com/youtube-playlist-to-linked-list-in-excel-why-not-3a96297e980c](https://dtomoffcpa.medium.com/youtube-playlist-to-linked-list-in-excel-why-not-3a96297e980c)


 - Similarly, archive twitter threads as pdf files. Use [threadreader](https://threadreaderapp.com/), then print the output webpage as a pdf and place it in archives/twitter


 - Image as many resources as possible on the internet archive, and use stable archive links in place of direct links.
