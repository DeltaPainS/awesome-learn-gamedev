Got resources? Notice a broken link? Email me, shoot me a DM, or make a pull request! I like chatting too - don't be shy! ^^

<br />

## About

For a few years now, I have been hoarding every gamedev resource I can get my grubby paws on. This is the result!

My list is mostly for learning the craft of game development at a high level and getting hired for it. For lists of tools, communities, and assets, as well as more granular lists geared towards individual tools like Unity, check out [the gaming category of awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#gaming)

Nearly all resources are free, and anything with a price tag will be clearly marked. I only include paid resources if either I have personally used them or I have seen other industry professionals use and recommend them.

Suggestions and future-proofing efforts are always welcome! 

These resources made my career possible. I hope they are just as helpful for you!

Disclaimer: I'm a technical artist and gameplay programmer, so most of my role-specific resources are geared towards the art and tech disciplines. However, there should be something for _most_ disciplines, particularly in general materials and other curated lists.

üü™ Purple Resources are ‚Äúmost useful‚Äù links. These include highly influential courses/books, resources I've personally found invaluable, and other entire mega-lists.
