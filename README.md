## About

For a few years now, I have been hoarding every gamedev resource I can get my grubby paws on. This is the result!

This list is aimed at learning the craft of game development. It has been curated to offer general knowledge, as well as resources for each role and general hiring advice. It also contains courses/tutorials for specific tools wherever they are required for a role, and assets whenever they would enable a person to learn their own role without having to learn a prerequisite fole (for example, the animation section contains rigs). For tools, communities, and assets, as well as more granular lists for individual tools like Unity, check out [the gaming category of awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#gaming)

Nearly all resources are free, and anything with a price tag will be clearly marked. Paid resources are only included if they have been personally endorsed by an industry professional working in the relevant discipline.

Suggestions and future-proofing efforts are always welcome! Check out `TODO.md` for tasks that need completing, such as archival work.

These resources made my career possible. I hope they are just as helpful for you!

Disclaimer: I'm a technical artist and gameplay programmer, so most of my role-specific resources are geared towards the art and tech disciplines. However, there should be something for _most_ disciplines, particularly in general materials and other curated lists.

🟪 Purple Resources are “most useful” links. These include highly influential courses/books, resources I've personally found invaluable, and other entire mega-lists.
